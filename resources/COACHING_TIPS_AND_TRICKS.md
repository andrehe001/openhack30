# Coaching Tips and Tricks

In this section, you will find non-technical related stuff like general structure of the event, Do's and Don'ts, how to coach, etc.

## Agenda for days of the OpenHack

OpenHacks vary in the number of days allocated to each event. However, they all follow a similar pattern in terms of coaching:

- Start of the Day - standup. The purpose is to update the coaches with any last-minute changes or updates that might impact their teams.
- OpenHack - working with teams.
- End of the Day - retrospective. The purpose of this is to gather feedback from coaches and have a check-in to measure each team's progress.
  > Note: This is not a competition, and teams are not measured against one another. The goal of the check-in is to see if any team is falling behind and needs additional attention or resources.

## The role of a Coach

The coach at the OpenHack is a guide/enabler, not a teacher. Avoid lecturing students on each challenge and pertaining topics, unless they ask for information and have also read the references at the bottom of each challenge `*`.

Ask pointed questions aimed at guiding the participants towards finding a solution. In some cases, this can cause frustration, which is understandable.

As a coach, you should also manage frustration levels on a team by team basis. If your team is truly stuck and have tried to find a solution on their own, you can provide a stronger hint and adjust as needed. We want them to learn, but also to walk away with a positive experience.

`*` The exception to this being around technology what is used in the challenge, but it is not the main theme of the OpenHack. If your team does not have a strong background in it, it's ok to give them a short introduction and teach them about basics. Also, if your team does require this, please include directly related stuff to your descriptions. This is an excellent opportunity to grab a whiteboard! If you don't feel confident explaining that technology, please find another coach to assist. The lead coach can help you with this as well.

## Do's and Don'ts

This section will cover the Do's and Don'ts of coaching.

### Do's

- Give suggestions and guide teams to find solutions on their own.
- Encourage teamwork and participation by everyone at your table.
- Be engaged and answer questions that may come up. If you don't know the answer, ask a fellow coach or the lead coach.
- Pay attention to personalities in your group. It's key for everyone to be respectful and work as a team, if any issues arise, bring them up to the lead coach and PM lead immediately.
- Identify high skilled individuals at your table and ask them to help you ensure everyone learns.
- Encourage your team to work on a shared monitor (each table should have one.) Also, ensure that they are rotating who is "driving".
- Encourage pair programming / mob programming.
- Recommend that teams use the visual (classic) pipeline editor instead of YAML. While YAML is preferred for production builds, the classic editor provides an easier onramp for folks that are learning.
- Encourage the team to use/read the references at the end of each challenge. Often times if they are struggling, it's because they didn't take time to read the references. It's OK to _not_ jump right into a solution.

### Don'ts

- Don't give out direct answers. Instead, guide people to finding the solutions themselves.
- Don't allow one person on the team to do all the work.
- Don't pass challenges unless everyone on the team demonstrates an understanding of the challenge solution. A good way to approach this is to let the team know that they either all pass together, or no one passes a challenge.
- Don't check your email or do work that is not part of the OpenHack. The goal of a coach is to provide a great experience by being engaged and available to your team.
- Don't leave for long periods. While it's ok to take a break and socialize with other coaches (it's even encouraged!), don’t' be away for too long. If you need to be away, please let the lead coach know so arrangements can be made.
- Don't spend a lot of time teaching something that is not directly related to the challenges. If attendees ask about something off-topic, give it a few minutes and then move them back on track. This is a good time to explore, and we want them to, but you need to make sure they stay focused on the DevSecOps journey.

## Team Building

It's essential to have the folks at your table work as a team. While they could be from the same company/organization, in many cases, they will not be and be a group meeting for the first time.

In order to bring everyone to the table, we've found introductions at the start of the day to be key. A recommended approach is to introduce yourself, then have each team member introduce themselves and provide the following information like:

- Name and Role
- Experience with DevOps and DevSecOps
- One interesting fact about themselves (non-work related)

It's also important to make it clear that they will be passed on challenges as a team if one person doesn't understand the solution or have issues, then the team does not pass that challenge.

Moreover, it helps to be explicit about recommending pair programming/mob programming and to ensure everyone gets a chance to drive/share.

Another important note for the team is to suggest they share findings. If they find a solution that's interesting, share it on the screen and explain it to the group. Often one person will work through lunch and solve an issue. It's a good idea when the team reconvenes to ask that person to explain to the group their solution.

Each team should have a dedicated chat mechanism. For internal teams, Microsoft Teams should be used. For teams with customers, any chat system will work (Slack, Teams, discord, etc.) Allow the team to decide what to use and also to create the channel/team. This gives the team more ownership over the process.

## Working through Challenges

The bulk of the event will be your team working on challenges for the OpenHack. The goal is for them to adding security into DevOps workflow to increase overall security, minimalize risk, and meet company security compliance.

A good workflow for each challenge includes the following:

- Ask the team to read the challenge as a group.
- Recommend they discuss their strategy for solving the challenge before starting to work.
- Ask them to read the references as that has information directly related to each challenge.
- Before starting to work, per a good DevOps culture, the team should create work items to represent the work they will perform. As a coach, this is a good check-in opportunity for you.
- Each challenge should be treated as a sprint with a spring planning to start, then retro at the end.
- As the team completes a challenge, they may ask for questions or clarifications from you.
- When they are finished, go through the completion criteria at the bottom of each challenge to ensure they have met the goals.
- After completing, have a quick retrospective to talk about the challenge. Specifically, ask for any feedback to improve their experience in upcoming challenges. This can be technical, but also workflow related.
- If a team member mentions they didn't do enough in this challenge and others did all the work, that’s a good indicator that you need to ensure they split up the work in the next challenge.

## How to Get Help

As you arrive at your table, get to know the coaches near you. They can assist you when stuck and will be a valuable asset. However, if you need extra help and attention, please do the following:

- Utilize the Teams channel (dedicated per OpenHack) and ask your question there.
- Find the lead coach or PM lead and ask them for assistance. They will help direct you towards experienced coaches who can assist.

## Submit Feedback

One of the coach responsibilities is to collect feedback from the team. Below you can find places where you can put your feedback:

- OpenHack content-related feedback send to your Lead Coach. He/She is responsible for collect, validate, aggregate, and finally send to the OpenHack development team.
